**I** don't blog much but a couple years ago I got interested in the different tooling
that exists for people that do.  The first version of my blog was a minimal Ghost blog.
It didn't get hosted anywhere.  I just wanted to go through the process of building
a blog to prove to myself I was capable of doing it.

A while later I learned what [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) was.  The
idea of free hosting for a website was super cool. I didn't have much of a reason to
have my own page but I have to admit the idea of having a spot on the Internet all to
myself was appealing.

When setting up my Github Pages blog it was recommended (by Github) that I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby.  I downloaded Ruby and the gems that were necessary
to tell Jekyll to spit out my static site and all was good in the world.  When I decided
I wanted to customize some things (which didn't take long decide) I had a hard time understanding
what was happening under the hood of Jekyll. Reading the source wasn't much help since
I only had a basic understanding of Ruby's syntax.  I decided it was time to try a
new static site generator in a language I knew.

I decided to switch to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) because at the time I was learning Go and wanted
to check out some larger projects written in the language.  If you're reading this blog
post then you're reading a site that was generated using Hugo.  I'll slowly be adding code
that existed in my old blog to this one so keep an eye for things for new/old content to pop up.
